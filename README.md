# docker-simple-nuget-server
Docker file and auto building of simple-nuget-server (https://github.com/Daniel15/simple-nuget-server)



# Plan

* Docker file download git repo
* Install prereq
* Add custom entry point
* Add travise to build.



## Note:
I tried https://github.com/sunsided/docker-nuget but had issues with the base url. Unfortuately this repo is not being maintained and I was unable to get it up and running again.
